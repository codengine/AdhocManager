## Adhoc Manager
The Adhoc Manager allows you to configure and start your Hosted/Adhoc Network as simple as possible. The need for it comes as that Microsoft removed the GUI in newer Windows versions.

### Requirements
- Windows XP/Vista/7/10 (32/64 Bit)
- WiFi Adapter
- An upstream connection to share (Dial-Up, Mobile, Ethernet etc.)

### Usage
1. Start the application as Administrator
2. Enter a SSID and password (optional, but recommended)
3. Click on Start
4. Click on "Manage Connections.." and Right Click on the Connection you want to share. Open "Properties -> Sharing" and enable the sharing for other users, select "Hosted Network" or similar as the Home Network Connection.
5. Connect your clients to your WiFi Network

### Troubleshooting
* If starting the network fails with a message like "Invalid State", try to disable and re-enable your WiFi Adapter
